MULTI
SLICECT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS
WITH CONTRAST
The study was performedadministering oral and intravenous contrast, Sagittal and coronal reconstructed views were also obtained.
There is a intense enhancible nodule with diameter of 10mm in superior segment of liver and another hypodense mass with diamention of 37*26mm in 6hepatic segment(inferior posterior segment)with peripheral nodular enhancement represented to hemangiomaA cystic appearance lesion(30*24mm)abutting to pancreatic body seems to be nerotic lymphnode
There are multiple LAPS in celiac axis,porta hepatic with mean short axis of 15mm as well as para aortic LAPS with mean short axis of 16mm
There are LAP in common iliac axis with mean short axis of 11mm also external iliac(pelvic)LAPS with mean short axis of 16mm
Spleen and pancreas are also normal
The kidneys are opacified
A cystic appearance lesion aproximately measured 52*37mm with septation in mid pole of lt kidney still is present(complicated renal cyst)
Lt sided hydronephrosis (calyceal actasia)and hydroureter due to pelvic LAPS still is visible
No paraaortic or paracaval adenopathy is present.
Pelvic organs are normal.
