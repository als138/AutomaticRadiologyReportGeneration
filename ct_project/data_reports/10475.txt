MULTI
SLICECT SCAN OF THE THORAX WITH CONTRAST
The study was performedadministering intravenous contrast and coronal reconstructed views were also obtained.
Rt pleural effusion as compared with previous study (20/12/91)is decreased but nodular pleural component seems unchanged
Partial passive collapse and linear strandying(fibrotic change)in RLL are seen
RUL,left lung parenchyma are clear
Lt pleural space is intact
Hypodense hepatic masses are noted (R/O metastasis)
DX:Rt pleural,RLL pathologic findinges(unchanged nodular/mass component,decreased effusion as comparison with previous study)
