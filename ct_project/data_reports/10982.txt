LTISLICE CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF ABDOMINAL AORTA
The study was performed administering bolus intravenous contrast, obtaining reconstructed MIP images.
Dissecting aneurismal dilatation of abdominal aorta under to renal arteries 140mm in length,55mm in rt to lt diameter 52
mm in A-P diameter with false lumen of 34mm and extention to common iliac arteries (more on rt side)with maximum diameter of 18mm are seen
External iliac arteries show calcified atheroma without aneurismal dilation
Celiac trunk,SMA,renal arteries no show significant stenosis or aneurysm.
A hypodense mass (27mm)in 7hepatic segment is seen
DX:Abdominal aorta dissecting aneurysm as explained above.
