LTISLICE CT SCAN OFTHE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST
The study was performedin axial views obtaining coronal reconstructed views.Lung parenchyma is clear with no active infiltration.
A few calcified lymphnodes in rt paratracheal aortopulmonary window with maximum short axis of 11mm
Anterior mediastinal lipomatosis is present
There are bilateral extensive reticulation,tubular and traction bronchiectasis prodominantly in subpleural location as well as bilateral irregular interlobar septal thickening throughout both lunges are seen
Ac
orrdance enlarged mediastinal lymphnodes and irregular septal thickening and patiente history(prostatic canser)lymphangitic carcinomatosis associated with ILD (IPF)is suggested
Otherwise of the study are unremarkable
