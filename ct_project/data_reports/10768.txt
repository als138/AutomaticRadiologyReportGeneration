MULTI
SLICECT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS
WITH CONTRAST
The study was performedadministering oral and intravenous contrast, Sagittal and coronal reconstructed views were also obtained.
There are multiple hypodense masses in both hepatic lobes largest approximately measured 62mm one large a mentioned above lesion merged to IVC and middle hepatic vein
Portal vein,billiary system seem to be normal
Multiple peritoneal seeding masses scatter
ed in abdominal and lower abdominal cavity,gutters with maximum diameter of 14mm and a large mesantric necrotic mass with calcification approximately measured 60*40mm in diamention could be to residue/recurrence tumor with peritoneal seeding
As compared previous study size of mentioned lesion has been decreased.
Spleen and pancreas are also normal with no S.O.L
The kidneys are opacified with no hydronephrosis.
No paraaortic or paracaval adenopathy is present.
Pelvic organs are normal.
DX:Unchanged hepatic masses(metastasis mesenteric mass and peritoneal seeding with decreased valume as compared previous study
