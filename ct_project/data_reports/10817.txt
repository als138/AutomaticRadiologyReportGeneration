MULTI
SLICECT SCAN OF THE THORAX WITH CONTRAST
The study was performedadministering intravenous contrast and coronal reconstructed views were also obtained.
Lung parenchyma is clear with no active infiltration.
A 8*4/5 cm heterogenous enhancing anterior prevascular mediastinal mass infavour of thymoma as same as previous study dated 20/12/91 is seen .
Multiple mediastinal adenopathies with maxium short axis of 25 mm is seen in prevascular , AP window ,Rt para and peritracheal and anterior cardiophrenic angle,
with focal cal
cification as same as last study.
A small pleural based
noduleof 5/5 mm is seen in anterior segment of RUL which is new finding needs follow up.
A 10*7 mm subpleural opacity is seen in right basal segment as same as previous study seemtobe plate atelectasia.
Increased interstitial marking and interlobular septal thickening is noted.
Pleural cavity is clear.
A 20*18 mm hypodense nodule is seen in
right thyroid lobe need correlation with sonography.
Bony thorax is normal.
